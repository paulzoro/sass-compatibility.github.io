- label: "`&` SassScript"
  name: ampersand_sassscript
  description: |
    The ability to use `&`, the reference to the current selector, in SassScript.
    This basically means that `&` can be manipulated, inspected and updated manually.
  polyfill: false





- label: "Angle conversion"
  name: angle_conversion
  description: |
    Angles can be emitted in four different units:

    * Degrees: `deg`
    * Radians: `rad`
    * Gradians: `grad`
    * Turns: `turn`

    Sass should be able to auto-convert angles from one unit to another.
  polyfill: |
    <pre class="language-scss"><code>@function convert-angle($value, $unit) {
      $convertable-units: deg grad turn rad;
      $conversion-factors: 1 10grad/9deg 1turn/360deg 3.1415926rad/180deg;
      @if index($convertable-units, unit($value)) and index($convertable-units, $unit) {
        @return $value
                 / nth($conversion-factors, index($convertable-units, unit($value)))
                 * nth($conversion-factors, index($convertable-units, $unit));
      }
      @error "Cannot convert `#{unit($value)}` to `#{$unit}`.";
    }</code></pre>





- label: "`@at-root` directive"
  name: at_root_directive
  description: |
    The [`@at-root`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#at-root) directive causes one or more rules to be emitted at the root of the document, rather than being nested beneath their parent selectors.
  polyfill: false





- label: "`call` function"
  name: call_function
  description: |
    The `call` function makes it possible to call a function dynamically, by referencing its name.
  polyfill: |
    Unfortunately, the `call` function is not easily polyfilled.
    You would have to create a function with a switch case for every existing function in the global scope;
    Sass default functions such as `quote` or `invert`, and your own functions as well.
    That's a pain and kind of defeats the initial purpose.





- label: "Cross-media `@extend`"
  name: cross_media_extend
  description: |
    One of the major downsides of the `@extend` directive from Sass is that it cannot be used to extend an outer-selector from within a `@media` context.
  polyfill: |
    Use a mixin instead.





- label: "Deep `@extend`"
  name: deep_extend
  description: |
    *Deep extend* names the situation where the `@extend` directive is being used from a compound selector, for instance `.a .b .c`.
  polyfill: false





- label: "Downward `@for`"
  name: downward_for
  description: |
    For long, there was no way to have decrementing `@for` loops. They could only go upward. No error was thrown, but it simply did not iterate.
  polyfill: |
    <pre class="language-scss"><code>@for $i from -10 through -1 {
      $i: abs($i);
      // Do something
    }</code></pre>





- label: "`@error` directive"
  name: error_directive
  description: |
    The [`@error`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_7) directive throws the value of a SassScript expression as a fatal error, including a nice stack trace. It’s useful for validating arguments to mixins and functions.
  polyfill: |
    <pre class="language-scss"><code>@if ($condition) {
      @warn $error;
      @return null;
    }</code></pre>





- label: "Feature detection functions"
  name: feature_detection_functions
  description: |
    Feature detection functions include `feature-exists`, `variable-exists`, `global-variable-exists`, `function-exists` and `mixin-exists`.
  polyfill: |
    Note that LibSass supports all functions but `feature-exists`.





- label: "Fixed `if` function"
  name: fixed_if_function
  description: |
    The [`if`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#if-instance_method) function returns one of two values, depending on whether or not `$condition` is true.
    Just like in `@if`, all values other than `false` and `null` are considered to be `true`.

    There has long been a bug with this function where all arguments where evaluated, no matter the result of the condition.
  polyfill: |
    Use a conditional statement (`@if` / `@else`).

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>// Instead of:
    // $value: if(length($list) > 2, nth($list, 3), nth($list, 1));

    $value: nth($list, 1);

    @if length($list) > 2 {
      $value: nth($list, 3);
    }</code></pre>





- label: "`inspect` function"
  name: inspect_function
  description: |
    The [`inspect`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#inspect-instance_method) function returns a string containing the value as its Sass representation.
    It is especially useful when printing lists and maps as CSS values.
  polyfill: false





- label: "`list-separator` function"
  name: list_separator_function
  description: |
    The [`list-separator`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#list_separator-instance_method) function returns the separator of a list.
    If the list doesn’t have a separator due to having fewer than two elements, returns `space`.
  polyfill: |
    <pre class="language-scss"><code>@function _list-separator($list) {
      @if function-exists("list-separator") == true {
        @return list-separator($list);
      }

      $test-list: ();
      @each $item in $list {
        $test-list: append($test-list, $item, space);
      }

      @return if($test-list == $list, space, comma);
    }</code></pre>





- label: "Map API"
  name: map_data_type
  description: |
    The Map API includes the `map` Sass data type and functions `map-get`, `map-merge`, `map-remove`, `map-keys`, `map-values`, `map-has-key` and `keywords`.
  polyfill: |
    Maps can be faked with bi-dimensional lists such as:

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>$map: (
      a 1,
      b 2,
      c 3
    );</code></pre>
    Then, [Sass List-Maps](https://github.com/lunelson/sass-list-maps) from Lu Nelson can be used to polyfill the whole Map API.





- label: "Media queries merge"
  name: media_merge
  description: |
    While nested media queries are valid CSS, they are quite uncommon.
    Also, some browsers (Internet Explorer and Opera) do not support nested media queries.
    Because of this, Sass is supposed to merge compatible nested media queries into a single one.
  polyfill: |
    Don't nest media queries and merge them manually.

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>// Instead of:
    // @media (min-width: 600px) {
    //   @media (max-width: 800px) { .. }
    // }

    @media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 800px) { .. }





- label: "Multi assignment `@each`"
  name: multi_assign_each
  description: |
    It is possible to assign several variables at once in an `@each` loop, which turns out to be especially useful when iterating over maps.
    For instance, `@each $key, $value in $map`. Learn more about [multi-assignment](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#each-multi-assign).
  polyfill: |
    Use a regular loop.

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>@each $item in $map {
      $key: nth($item, 1);
      $value: nth($item, 2);
      // Do something
    }</code></pre>





- label: "Multi keys `map-remove`"
  name: multi_keys_map_remove
  description: |
    Some engines cannot remove multiple keys of a map at once with the [`map-remove`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#map_remove-instance_method) function.
  polyfill: |
    <pre class="language-scss"><code>@function map-multi-remove($map, $keys...) {
      @each $key in $keys {
        $map: map-remove($map, $key);
      }
      @return $map;
    }</code></pre>





- label: "Negative indexes"
  name: negative_indexes
  description: |
    All list functions support negative indexes in order to start from the last item in the list rather than the first.
    For instance, `nth($list, -1)` returns the last item from `$list`.
  polyfill: |
    Substract indexes to the result of `length` function.

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>// Instead of:
    // $value: nth($list, -3);

    $value: nth($list, length($list) - 2);
    </code></pre>





- label: "Nested interpolations"
  name: nested_interpolations
  description: |
    Interpolations (`#{..}`) can be nested.
  polyfill: |
    Not only nested interpolations are quite uncommon, but it also turns out to be easy to refactor the code so it doesn't happen.





- label: "`random` function"
  name: random_function
  description: |
    The [`random`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#random-instance_method) function returns a decimal between 0 and 1, inclusive.
    When given an argument, it returns a decimal between 0 and the given number.
  polyfill: false





- label: "`rebeccapurple` color"
  name: rebeccapurple_color
  description: |
    The `rebeccapurple` CSS color can safely be used, yet it cannot be manipulated as a color.
  polyfill: |
    Use `#663399`. You could stuff it in a variable.

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>$rebeccapurple: #663399;</code></pre>





- label: "Reserved function names"
  name: reserved_function_names
  description: |
    Sass is supposed to throw an error if one tries to create and call functions named `or`, `not` or `and`.
  polyfill: |
    Name your functions differently.





- label: "Selector manipulation functions"
  name: selector_manipulation_functions
  description: |
    Selector manipulation functions include `selector-nest`, `selector-append`, `selector-extend`, `selector-replace`, `selector-unify`, `is-superselector`, `simple-selectors` and `selector-parse`.
  polyfill: false





- label: "`set-nth` function"
  name: set_nth_function
  description: |
    The [`set-nth`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#set_nth-instance_method) function returns a new list, based on the list provided, but with the nth element changed to the value given.
  polyfill: |
    <pre class="language-scss"><code>@function update-nth($list, $n, $value) {
      @if function-exists("set-nth") == true {
        @return set-nth($list, $n, $value);
      }
      $new-list: ();
      @for $i from 1 through length($list) {
        $new-list: append($new-list, if($i == $n, $value, nth($list, $i)));
      }
      @return $new-list;
    }</code></pre>





- label: "Spaces around minus symbol"
  name: spaces_minus
  description: |
    Spaces around the minus symbol should not be mandatory if the value before the `-` sign is a function call.
  polyfill: |
    Wrap the minus symbol with spaces to prevent any issue and easy readibility.

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>.foo {
      content: getter() - 1;
    }</code></pre>





- label: "String manipulation functions"
  name: string_manipulation_functions
  description: |
    String manipulation functions include `str-length`, `str-insert`, `str-index`, `str-slice`, `to-upper-case` and `to-lower-case`.
  polyfill: false





- label: "`transparent` color"
  name: transparent_color
  description: |
    The `transparent` CSS color can safely be used, yet it cannot be manipulated as a color.
  polyfill: |
    Use `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`. You could stuff it in a variable.

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>$transparent: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);</code></pre>





- label: "`unique-id` function"
  name: unique_id_function
  description: |
    The [`unique-id`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#unique_id-instance_method) function returns a unique CSS identifier.
    The identifier is returned as an unquoted string.
    The identifier returned is only guaranteed to be unique within the scope of a single Sass run.
  polyfill: false





- label: "Variable scoping"
  name: variable_scoping
  description: |
    Not all engines work with the same variable scoping mechanism.
    Actually, some don't have variable scoping at all, which means all variables live in the same global environment (and can overlap).
    Some engines do have the new variable scoping system, where a variable is restricted to its scope (function, mixin...) if it's not set with the `!global` flag.
  polyfill: |
    This can be **detected** with:

    <pre class="language-scss"><code>feature-exists("global-variable-shadowing") == true</code></pre>
